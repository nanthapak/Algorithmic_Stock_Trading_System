# ALGORITHMIC STOCK TRADING SYSTEM

I'm learn how to trade stock from my dad and when i do some research there are thing called technical indicator.
It's a tool calculated from stock's data which is very powerful if you use it wisely ,but there are so many of them.
It make me think that what if i create a algorithm that decide that based on the data wouldn't that be very powerful.  
so i build this project with my freind and its turn out to be very good and win multiples award.

Automatic generating trading signal (Buy/Sell/Hold) through optimization using Differential Evolution Algorithm.  
The parameter of the optimization algorithm is the weigth of well-known technical indicator such as RSI, MA, and MACD and some other self researched ones.   

CODE - contain all of the code from creating a technical indicator to training a model.  
Papar - contain research papers, certificate and reward of the project.  
Streamlit - contain website code.
